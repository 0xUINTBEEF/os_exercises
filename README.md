# Operating System Concepts Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various operating system concepts in C, including process scheduling, memory management, file systems, and synchronization mechanisms.

## Features

### Process Management
- Process creation and termination
- Process scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin)
- Process synchronization using semaphores and mutexes

### Memory Management
- Page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal)
- Memory allocation strategies
- Virtual memory simulation

### File Systems
- Basic file system operations
- File allocation methods
- Directory structure implementation

### Synchronization
- Producer-Consumer problem
- Dining Philosophers problem
- Readers-Writers problem
- Peterson's algorithm
- Monitor implementation

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- C compiler (gcc)
- POSIX-compliant operating system
- ncurses library (for UI)

### Build Instructions
```bash
# Clone the repository
